I cant use triplets for the answers due to the use of text box answers not using the triplet answer format.
I will have to use a twin answer analyzer that finds all answers of the same name (which is the question's array number
followed be the question number) then gets their answer and adds it to the question's answered list for saving and scoring.
The question's answered list will be stored in an object which is then stored in an asosiative array to store it. 
// i can use this for number identification "/[0-9]/"  <--this is a regular expression
